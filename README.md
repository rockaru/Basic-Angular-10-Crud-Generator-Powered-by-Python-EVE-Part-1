# Basic-Angular-10-Crud-Generator-Powered-by-Python-EVE-Part-1

In this tutorial we'll build the REST API using Python EVE framework, learn how to use Cerberus validation system to add support for new schema fields and expose the schema endpoint. 

To get started just clone the repository

# git clone https://github.com/rockaru/Basic-Angular-10-Crud-Generator-Powered-by-Python-EVE-Part-1

Make sure you have an instance of MongoDB running
start the server

# python run.py

Next, we'll create a new angular 10 app, write the Form Service to consume the structure API and basic Crud Components.
